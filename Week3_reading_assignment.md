## Week 3 Reading Assignment: Geoff Boeing

#### Response

After reading "Off the Grid... and Back Again? The Recent Evolution of American Street Network Planning and Design" by Geoff Boeing and listening to his talk with the previous class, I find it interesting how he created a system to model street griddedness, tying in relevant variables and using mathematical analyses to produce results. I'm optimistic that griddedness, and therefore density, active transportation, and sustainability are making a comeback in American cities, since the current climate crisis calls for moves toward sustainable development practices. 

The paper left me with a couple thoughts and questions.

1. How would this system of measuring griddedness relative to active transportation and sustainability in the US compare to cities abroad? I specifically think of Singapore, where street grids are scarce, but public transit and green space is plentiful. 

2. The article mainly looks at the long-range patterns of grid development in the US. I would be interested to see if there are any changes in grid pattern or layout due to shocks to a city, such as the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake or Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
