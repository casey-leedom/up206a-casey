"Global Trends toward Urban Street-network Sprawl" - Christopher Barrington-Leigh and Adam Millard-Ball

In the article "Global Trends toward Urban Street-network Sprawl", Barrington-Leigh and Millard-Ball decribe trends in street-network sprawl at local, national, and global levels. They break out data into four time periods: pre-1975, 1975-1989, 1990-1999, and 2000-2014 in order to analyze trends in increased or decreased sprawl on a temporal scale. Street-network sprawl is measured based on the "street-network disconnectedness index" (SNDi), where a higher SNDi corresponds to greater sprawl. The authors emphasize the importance of looking at street-network connectedness, as its permanence in the urban form dictates modes of transportation, and therefore CO2 emissions. Street-network connectedness also greatly influences future transit opportunities, walkability, economic development, and access to community resources. It also tends to mimic itself - disconnected neighborhoods are likely to influence neighboring developments to be disconnected as well. Policy and design guidance can curb these trends, and have done so in several high-income countries in recent years.

I found this quantitative analysis of sprawl to be interesting. Barrington-Leigh and Millard-Ball lay out eight types of grids (Figure 4), each of which differ greatly, but some of which have similar SNDi values. It's unsurprising that grids of type E (gated communities) have increased in the U.S. I wonder if this could be correlated not only with increased income inequality in urban areas, but also increased segregation. 

Questions:
1. Japan has consistently had low street-network sprawl. Are there certain policies or practices in Japan that have contributed to this trend? Is it mostly based on the existence of an efficient transit network, and therefore less of an importance placed on personal vehicles? 
2. Are there possibilities within the U.S. to increase SNDi for already-existing developments with low SNDi's? One solution mentioned in Europe was pedestrian and bike access between disconnected streets. It seems like this would be difficult to implement retroactively, but would it have much of an effect? Maybe there are opportunities where residents are already close to a business or resource, and providing a connection point would provide value for residents.
