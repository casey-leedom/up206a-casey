### Summary

"Spatial Data for Slum Upgrading: Volunteered Geographic Information and the Role of Citizen Science", by Hachmann et al., investigates the possibility of using Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and Citizen Science (CS) as participatory planning tools to collect spatial data of informal settlements and promote slum upgrading projects. Informal settlements (slums) around the world are marginalized and illegalized by the state, and often do not have access to city services such as potable water, sanitation, and electricity. Spatial data for informal settlements is minimal, and is primarily created through a top-down approach. Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) is one form of participatory collection of spatial data that has been used for studying slum upgrading, but it has not been proven to significantly affect influence of citizen input in the planning process. VGI and CS are two potential bottom-up processes for collecting data that would rely on citizen input. VGI may be challenging because it requires voluntary data input, which may skew data, and requires that citizens have the means and skillsets to input GIS data. CS uses citizen knowledge as scientific data, but does not output spatial information. Both tools may provide opportunity for particpatory planning for slum upgrading, but would need to be further researched. The main goal for any participatory form of planning within informal settlements is establishing a collaborative effort between local agencies, planners, and citizens such that citizen-provided data is recognized as legitimate and influences urban policy.

### Reflection

I chose this article based on my interests in international development, informal settlements, and participatory urban planning. I've previously read articles about slum demolition in India, and favela incorporation in Brazil. Because informal settlements are so prevalent across the world (even within the US), it is imperative to consider these residents' right to the use value of land. There is a lot of contention between the legality and illegality of these spaces and the role of governments in providing housing or city services for their lowest-income populations. In considering projects for spatial data analysis, I wondered about access to data on informal settlements. I was excited to find this article, which gives insight into the data that is available on informal settlements, and also considers how spatial data science can be participatory and influence outcomes for slumdwellers. I am interested in exploring how spatial data science can be used as a tool for participatory urban planning both domestically and internationally.
